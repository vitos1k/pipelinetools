My tools i use in a production pipeline in a softwares such as blender/houdini/after effects

# â€¢ io_aftereffects_export_with_curves.py
    Addon for blender 2.8+  It exports cameras/empties/curves and lamps from blender  to after effects. 3d curves from blender
    are exported as 2d masks on 2d layers in camera space. Currently works only with regular cameras, panoramic support to be
    added later
